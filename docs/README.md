# zenbukkowa Documentation Canon

## Goal

Define the canonical behavior and maintenance contracts for the plugin in an LLM-first format.

## Rules

1. Docs are authoritative; implementation follows docs.
2. Update docs contracts before code in every behavior-changing batch.
3. Keep one `README.md` per docs directory as the local table of contents.
4. Keep docs files at `<= 300` lines and authored source files at `<= 200` lines.
5. Prefer stable headings, terse bullets, and one canonical definition per concept.
6. Update parent `README.md` files in the same batch as child doc changes.
7. Prefer action-stable interaction contracts over click-type divergence.
